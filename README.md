Simple game to find all possible words given a dictionary using directions up, down, left, right from each block. 

## Getting Started

There is a main method on the <code>Game</code> object.

### Prerequisities

None

### Other

I think the <code>Word</code>object was probably overkill, but in the future, the score could be tabulated in that object.
